    <h2>How does SPUR work?</h2>
    After defining destination address and NAV amount to deliver, SPUR provides an address and the full amount to transfer including the specified fee.<br>
    Send the full amount to the SPUR given address and your NAVS will be delivered using NAVTech nodes.

    <h2>Why is it anonymous?</h2>
    We believe that you are familiar with NAVTech if you arrived here, otherwise please take a deeper look to technical details on their White Paper: http://navcoin.org/downloads<br>
    SPUR sends the transactions through NAVTech anon servers, making impossible to link originator of the transaction to destinatary.<br>
    Both the amount and the destination of the transaction are encrypted using KBPGP javascript library on your browser before leaving your computer, so even a MITM attack or being spied by your government/ISP wouldn't compromise your anonimity.<br>
    To further improve anonymity, we decided to launch SPUR only as a hidden service on TOR. <br>Please double check that the address you are accessing is the right one: http://4su7pqq6nyaecqoo.onion

    <h2>Could any of the involved addresses be tracked or linked to the transaction?</h2>
    Every address is unique and generated for each transaction and will be only used one time.<br>


    <h2>Why do I receive the amount in several transactions on the destiny address?</h2>
    Dividing the amount in different transactions and addresses makes impossible to link directly the transaction amount with the destiny, increasing the anonymity.

    <h2>Why SPUR?</h2>
    SPUR is a perfect solution to send anonymous NAV transactions from all type of wallets or systems.<br>Without the need to set up the required servers or full nodes, and adding the extra security layer of TOR.

    <h2>Additional security measures</h2>
    In order to remove any possibility of transfers tracking, we automatically remove the generated address and transfers from our servers 12 hours after the transaction has been done.

    <h2>What happens if I send a different amount?</h2>
    If the sent amount is lower, the anon transaction will not be executed.<br> You will see the reached amount on the screen and you can do another transfer to fulfill the full amount. <br><b>Please be aware that if the remaining amount is not delivered before the transaction operation expires, the money will not be returned.</b><br> You have 6 hours to do so.<br>
    If the amount is higher, only the amount requested will be delivered to destination.<br>Please ensure to send the exact amount.

    <h2>What can I do if the browser is closed before the transaction is done?</h2>
    You can go to the history and use the last url of spur used. <br>You will be able to access to that url before its expiry time of 6h.

    <h2>What if I have a problem?</h2>
    As we don't keep track of any transaction data, it is possible that we cannot help you if anything goes wrong. We suggest checking the transaction at Navcoin Blockexplorer https://chainz.cryptoid.info/nav/.<br>
